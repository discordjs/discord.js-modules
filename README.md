## Status: pre-alpha
The idea behind -next is to rewrite the entire library in typescript to make use of type safety and other TS features during development. We will still release it as a javascript library via the NPM registry.

Being a full rewrite this will be a bit of a larger undergoing, so we encapsulate it in its own repository. Discord.js version 13 is in its finishing strides over at https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js . We do currently not have a roadmap or estimate on a release date for the rewrite under -next.
